A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.

Yes, you can run both commands in a single `Process.run` by using a shell command. This can be done by combining the commands using shell syntax. Hereâ€™s how you can do it in Dart:

1. **Import the required library**:

   ```dart
   import 'dart:io';
   ```

2. **Define a function to run the combined command**:

   You can use a shell command to combine both commands into one:

   ```dart
   Future<void> getCommitsAfterLastTag() async {
     try {
       // Combined command to get commits after the last tag
       var command = 'git log \$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline';
       
       var result = await Process.run('bash', ['-c', command]);

       if (result.exitCode != 0) {
         print('Error getting commits: ${result.stderr}');
         return;
       }

       // Print the commits
       print(result.stdout);
     } catch (e) {
       print('An error occurred: $e');
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Call the function**:

   As before, you can call this function from your `main` function:

   ```dart
   void main() async {
     await getCommitsAfterLastTag();
   }
   ```

### Explanation

- **bash -c**: This allows you to run the combined command as a single string. The command will be interpreted as if it were typed into a shell.
- **\$**: The dollar sign is escaped (`\$`) to ensure it is passed correctly to the shell for variable expansion.

### Note

Make sure that the Dart code is executed in an environment where `bash` is available (such as on Unix-like systems) or adjust it to use `cmd.exe` on Windows accordingly. Here's how to adjust it for Windows:

```dart
var command = 'git log ^(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline';
var result = await Process.run('cmd', ['/c', command]);
```

This approach allows you to fetch the commits in a single call!
