### From chatGPT
Calculating the semantic version of your Flutter app follows the principles of Semantic Versioning (SemVer), which typically uses a format like `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Here’s a breakdown of how to determine each part:

1. **MAJOR**: Increase this number when you make incompatible API changes. If your app introduces features or changes that break existing functionality, you need to bump the major version.

2. **MINOR**: Increment this number when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner. If you introduce new features but maintain backward compatibility, you should increase the minor version.

3. **PATCH**: Increase this number when you make backward-compatible bug fixes. If you fix issues or make minor improvements that don’t change the functionality, bump the patch version.

### Steps to Calculate the Version:

1. **Identify Changes**:
   - List out the changes made since the last version.
   - Classify each change as a major, minor, or patch change.

2. **Bump the Version**:
   - If you have breaking changes, increment the MAJOR version and reset MINOR and PATCH to zero.
   - If you added new features but no breaking changes, increment the MINOR version and reset PATCH to zero.
   - If you made only bug fixes, increment the PATCH version.

3. **Example**:
   - Current version: `1.2.3`
     - If you add a new feature: New version should be `1.3.0`
     - If you fix a bug: New version should be `1.2.4`
     - If you introduce a breaking change: New version should be `2.0.0`

### Additional Considerations:

- **Pre-release Versions**: You can add labels like `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc` (release candidate) to denote pre-release versions (e.g., `1.2.3-alpha`).
- **Build Metadata**: You can also add build metadata after a plus sign (e.g., `1.2.3+001`).

### Versioning Best Practices:

- **Keep a Changelog**: Document all changes and their classifications for clarity.
- **Consistency**: Be consistent with how you categorize changes to avoid confusion.
- **Communication**: Ensure that your team and users are aware of version changes and their implications.

By following these principles, you can effectively manage the semantic versioning of your Flutter app!

### What i understand
1. None of the number (major.minro.patch) incremented by number of features or fixes. They always incremented by one based on the feature/fix added no matter how many. per release they'll be incremented by 1.

A **breaking change** refers to any modification in a system, software, or API that is **not backward-compatible**, meaning it disrupts or breaks existing functionality or usage patterns. When a breaking change is introduced, it often requires users, developers, or clients interacting with the system to update their code or behavior to accommodate the change. 

### Key Aspects of Breaking Changes
1. **Backward Compatibility is Lost**  
   Older versions of the system, code, or clients are no longer able to function as expected without modification.

2. **Requires Updates on the Client Side**  
   Users or developers must adapt their usage, such as updating API calls, rewriting parts of their code, or reconfiguring dependencies.

3. **Impact Scope**  
   Breaking changes can affect various components, including APIs, libraries, user interfaces, or workflows.

### Examples of Breaking Changes

#### 1. **API Example**  
   - **Before the Change:** An API endpoint accepts a parameter `age` as an integer.  
     ```json
     POST /users
     { "name": "John", "age": 30 }
     ```
   - **Breaking Change:** The parameter `age` is now renamed to `years_old`.  
     ```json
     POST /users
     { "name": "John", "years_old": 30 }
     ```
   - **Impact:** Existing clients using `age` will fail unless they update their code.

#### 2. **Library/Framework Example**  
   - **Before the Change:** A function `get_user()` returns a user object.  
   - **Breaking Change:** `get_user()` now requires an argument, `id`, to fetch a user.  
     ```python
     # Old behavior
     user = get_user()

     # New behavior (breaking change)
     user = get_user(id=123)
     ```
   - **Impact:** Code using the old signature will break until updated.

#### 3. **UI/UX Example**  
   - **Before the Change:** A "Submit" button is always visible on a form.  
   - **Breaking Change:** The button only becomes visible after filling all fields.  
   - **Impact:** Users who relied on the button's visibility may experience confusion or workflow disruption.

### Strategies to Mitigate Breaking Changes
1. **Versioning**: Introduce breaking changes in a new version (e.g., API v2) while maintaining backward compatibility in the older version.
2. **Deprecation Notices**: Warn users ahead of time about upcoming breaking changes and provide a transition period.
3. **Documentation**: Clearly document what has changed, why it changed, and how users can update their usage.
4. **Feature Flags or Phased Rollouts**: Allow users to opt into new changes before enforcing them.

Breaking changes should be implemented with caution, as they can lead to user dissatisfaction or churn if not communicated and managed effectively.
